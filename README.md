| <img width="593" alt="Userstory" src="https://github.com/gj1997x/Software-Requirements/assets/148683770/65266ad8-22d9-4c72-89ab-902dc447a113"> |<img width="832" alt="Userstory2" src="https://github.com/gj1997x/Software-Requirements/assets/148683770/978ad02c-aab7-43d4-a253-52710fe359a4">

The user story is natural language description on the of a features or functionalities of the system from the perspective of the user or stakeholder. The main purposes of the userstory are defining the requirements from users perpective such that it captures the users need from the system. Userstory also create a shared language between developers and stakeholders. In addition, userstory are needed to be done in the early stages, allowing for adjustments as more information becomes available. As of testability, userstory provide a clear goal for what needs to be developed and tested, ensuring that the delivered feature meets the user's needs. The userstory states the user or stakeholder that supposed to use this functionality and a description of the expected actions the system must do. It also illustrates the basice flow in detailed steps and what should happen in each step and by whom (User/System). Lastly is the Alternative flow, were it states if errors are triggered and how would the system recover from those errors. In the screenshots above are the userstory of the Electronic Store 111 that represents each actors, description of usecase, the basic flow and the alternative flow.



#### Usecase Diagram:

<img width="742" alt="Use Case Diagram" src="https://github.com/gj1997x/Software-Requirements/assets/148683770/072ad39e-147c-41ad-a653-cb7bd4f56fc3">

The purpose of usecase diagrams is to shows a highlevel overview of the usecases, actors and their interactions within the system. In the image above it can be clearly seen that the actors within the system are Customer/LoyaltyMember which can be guest or member, Cashier, Store Manager, Supplier and all of these actors belong to User. Each actor has a specific functions that can perform depending on their role in the system. There are in total 22 usescases in the system which each usecase provide a function in the Electronic store 111 system. Each actor is associated with a specific usecase that represents the functions that can be done on the systems. The Customer/LoyaltyMember is associated with signup, browseProducts, checkOut, paymentValidation, returnProduct, reviewCart, modifyCart, membershipStatus and giveFeedback. The Cashier is associated with scanProducts, processCheckout, processPayment, processReturn and printReceipt. The Store Manager can viewReports, manageInventory and accessFeedback. The Supplier can interact with the system by proccessOrders, viewNewOrders. Lastly, is the User which consist of all of the actors within the system such that their main interaction within the system is the systemLogin.

#### System Sequence Diagram:

##### Description: 

The sequence diagram is used to visualize the interactions between different actors in a system which include (Customer/Loyalty Member,Cashier, Store Manager and Supplier). This captures the interactions representing their order within the system. Sequence diagrams also clarify the requirements such that it can be as a tool of communication between the stalk holder and the developer. This result of having a clear understanding of how different parts of the system should interact. Furthermore, during the development the sequence diagram can be considered as a reference for the developer which ensures that these interactions are coded correctly. Finally, one of the main purpose of having sequence diagram is that it can be part of the systems documentation that can serve as a reference for future improvements on the system. In the screenshots below are examples of sequence diagrams and which actors are interacting with the system on a specific usecase with an illustrations of the interactions.

##### 1. Customer/LoyalMember - Return Product: 
On this specific sequence diagram there are four main operations that are involved. The first operation getTransaction which will take an input from the user which is the transactionID that user had when first he/she bought the product. The second operation is productID which will take the productID from the user that they want to return. The third operation is getReason which will take the reson of return from the user. The las operation saveReturn eill take as input the customerID from the system and the three parameters taken from the user which will save them in the systems database for further actions.

##### 2. Cashier:
This sequence diagram is the scanProduct which consists of mainly two operations and they are scanProducts and updateCart. The first operation is the scanProducts such which  will take the barcode number which is the productID and quantity as a parameters. The second operation is updateCart, and it will take the productID, productName, quantity, price, and cartID as an input. It will countinously update the specific current cart depending on the cartID and will make calculations on the stock due to the quantity specified. Finally, it will also calculate the new price of the current cart as soon as the product get scanned.

##### 3. Store Manager:
This specific sequence diagram represents several interactions occuring in the order shown on the screenshot. The first operation that will take place is viewInventoryStockLevel() that will output all of the productcs stock level whinin the store. Secondly, is the recordRestock(), that will take inputs (productName,productID, quantity) from the manager about the products details. Thirdly is the creatingNewSupplier() that will invoke the store manager to provide details of the new supplier such as supplierID, companyName, contactDetails. Thirdly is the sendToSupplier() which takes the information about the supllier of a specific products for restock orders.Lastly is the orderStockProducts(). This operation will have a paramaters such as productID, quantity, restockProductsID and will include the suppliers information taken earlier which will allow it to send orders to the correct supplier.

##### 4. Supplier:
In this diagram it can clearly be seen that it includes two operations occuring in a specific order. The first operation will be processStoreOrder() that will take three parameters which are orderID, productID, quantity. This will allow the system to know that the supplier has recieved and now processing the requested order. The second operation is called provideDeliveryInfo() which will take three parameters from the supplier. Those parameters are the order details such as orderID, date expected and wareHouseID which then can be used to update the order status.

#### Conceptual Class Diagram:
This diagram is a structure diagramthat represents a high level view of of the conceptual structure of the system. Its purpose is to help in domain understanding such that stakeholders and developers understand the main concepts of the domain and how these concepts are related to each other. Conceptual class diagram also frames the problem such that stakeholders can see the main elements involved. This type of diagram mainly focuses on illustrating key classes, and their relationships.
Elements in Conceptual Class DIagram:
1. key Entities: the primary elements in the domain (Rectangles).
2. Relationships: It shows how classes are related together which can be associations, aggregations, compositions, or generalizations (arrows).
3. Multiplicity: It shows how one instance of one class that can related to one instance of another class.
4. Attributes: It describes the value that an instance of a class can have and these attributes are associated with their type.

The Object Constraint Language (OCL) serves an extension to UML that allows for more precise rules and conditions for UML models. It lets us set clear constraints on system attributes and relationships.  One of its cardinal roles is to allow for the clear definition of constraints, ensuring conditions within a system remain consistently true, particularly in relation to attributes or relationships of classes. OCL provides a robust mechanism to perform queries on UML models, extracting specific data or subsets as needed. OCL also outlines both what needs to happen before an operation starts (preconditions) and the expected results after it ends (postconditions). IN the screenshot above shows some of the OCL contracts of the Electronic Store 111 system.

1. Updating Loyalty Points: It takes two parameters of points and memberID and fincds the desired member depending on the specific ID. The precondition such that this ID should exists. Finally, for the post condition it will add the points to the current value.  
2. Membership Status: The pervious contract takes in the memberID in the code and this contract will desplay the data within this instance which matches the customerID. Precondition is that this member should exists and the post condition is showing the instance details.
3. Scan Product: This contract will take two inputs which are barcode and quantity. the barcode is considered as the productID were it will be used to retrieve the product instance that matches the same productID. The contract will check the current level of the stock and if the condition is satified, it will used a function thats called Updatecart which will update the current cart. The precondition is that the quantity should be greater than zero and the product exists. In the other hand is the post condition which will checks the quantity and update the cart.
4. Save Feedback: It will take two parameters which are the customerID and the textFeedback. Perviously I took the customer feedback and saved it in a variable with other important data. This contract will create a new object of feedback class and fill in the required data that have been entered by the user. The precondition is that the parameters shouldnt be ampty and the post condition is to create the new object and save data.
